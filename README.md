# NORVI-EX-ANQ04
4 Channel Analog Output Expansion module.
 
NORVI is always about connectivity and expandability. This is the time to make use of the Expansion port of NORVI Controllers. 
The series of expansion modules connect to NORVI IoT controllers via its I2C and UART connections. 
You can add more features to the NORVI Controller without huge customizations. 
NORVI provides true technology with reliability for industrial applications being the world's IoT hardware manufacturer.

4-Channel Analog Output Expansion
4 – 20mA / 0 – 20mA / 0 – 10V Modes 
Can be used for ESP32-based PLC, especially for NORVI controllers.
12bit Analog Values can be written into a slave device using I2C
I2C Expansion for Analog Outputs
Built-in Diagnostics and Alert Features. 
Robust Architecture. 
DIN-Rail mount
